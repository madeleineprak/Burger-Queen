# Burger-Queen

This is an app where you can eat all the burgers you want in the world without gaining a single pound. Enjoy it [here](https://burgerqueen-devmad.herokuapp.com/)!

## Tools Utilized
* Express
* Express Handlebars
* JAWS DB
* MySQL
* Heroku

## How To Use
You can eat any burger you want by clicking the "Eat" button next to it which will move it to the eaten section. Once in the eaten section, the user can throw it away. If the user doesn't see the burger they want on the screen they can specifiy any burger they want to be able to add and eat.

## How It Works
The app stores the burgers in a database and each time the user clicks either the eat or delete button, it manipulates the database which then is reflected on the page.
